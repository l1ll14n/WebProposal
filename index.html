			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
      The RSPCA is involved in many aspects of animal welfare, both for pets and farm animals. Some of their responsibilites include: animal care, enforcing animal welfare law, animal advocacy, welfare of farm animals, and the scientific research of animal welfare. They accept the following contributions (1): 
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Monetary donations (either up front, or amounts left in wills)
          </li>
          <li> 
            Corporate support
          </li>
          <li> 
            Workplace giving (monetary donations directly through employer pay pre-tax)
          </li>
          <li> 
            Foster care of animals
          </li>
          <li> 
            Fundraising and events (also monetary donations, but raised by external sources with the express purpose of donating some/all of the income to the charity)
          </li>
          <li> 
            Volunteering
          </li>
          <li> 
            Buying their products through World of Pets
          </li>
        </ul>
      <!-- Removed for lack of relevance <blockquote

      <p>
      The RSPCA has quite a few avenues of monetary contribution and clearly it works for them: their total income  (from the most recent AIS) was $10,286,037. The biggest sectors of their income are Donations/Bequests and Goods/Services, so they don't need help accumulating monetary help (2). People were clamboring to adopt pets throughout the COVID, so the RSPCA wasn't in much need of help recruiting potential adoptive families either(3). These data sets and well-informed observations eliminated most of the charity support methods as needing improvement or reiteration. The one support approach that needed bolstering was the volunteer network, so the focus of the proposed webpage is the encouragement of people to volunteer their time at RSPCA centres.
      </p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
      <h4 id="r_secondary">Secondary</h3>
      <p>
        Besides the animal fostering support system, the volunteering method of supporting the system is the most vast and the most confusing. There are multiple sectors within the RSPCA that you can volunteer for:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Caring for animals in the shelters
        </li>
        <li>
          Shop fronts
        </li>
        <li>
          Special events/fundraisers
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The volunteer jobs vary in their requirements depending on their purview. The current RSPCA volunteer website for NSW has five areas the user can utilise to narrow down the volunteering options to what works best for them (4):
        <ul>
        <li>
          Types of Roles
        </li>
        <li>
          Categories of Roles
        </li>
        <li>
          Age Restrictions
        </li>
        <li>
          Time Commitment (amount of time needed per volunteering session)
        </li>
        <li>
          Availability (when during the week and at what time of day the volunteer is available)
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        While each section is successful at communicating its specialty, each section has a different volunteering options not available in the others. This functionality could be improved by having the user fill out a form or survey and displaying the options that fit their choices, as opposed to them clicking through all of the options in an attempt to find what they're looking for. The titles aren't entirely clear either, so they would also need to be improved. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When searching for open volunteer positions, the RSPCA website redirects the user to an outside page. To navigate back to the original page and continue the process of signing up to volunteer, the user would have to backtrack. Instead of redirecting from the proclaimed four steps to becoming a volunteer, the process of finding viable volunteer positions should be on the same page and part of the process (5). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The current sign up site proports to have four steps (6):
        <figure>
          <img src="Images/RSPCA4Steps.png" alt="screenshot of RSPCA website" style="width:100%">
        </figure>
        The steps that can be executed via the proposed website would be the first and a signup for the second, as both the inductions and in-person training for the chosen volunteer position would be executed through the RSPAs already set up systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Central California SPCA published an article in 2015 outlining the seven benefits of volunteering at an animal shelter. While this only pertains to one of the volunteering avenues the RSPCA offers, the article is full of ideas for possible motivations of users, for any of the volunteering positions (8).
              <ul>
          <li>
            It makes you feel like you're doing the right thing.
          </li>
          <li> 
            You get the near instantaneous reward of seeing improvement in an animal's demeanor.
          </li>
          <li> 
            Animal shelter volunteers are needed.
          </li>
          <li> 
            Volunteering at an animal shelter is good for your health; emotional, physical, and mental.
          </li>
          <li> 
            Gain experiences: professional and life.
          </li>
          <li> 
            Contribute to a cause you care about.
          </li>
          <li> 
            Learning responsibility and time management.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        Linette Phang volunteered at the Santa Paws Christmas Market in Queensland in 2017. She decided to volunteer because she had the time (her final exams had just finished) and she wanted to do something meaningful with it. Overall, she reported having a great time volunteering and highly recommended it to anyone else with the time and the need to do something meaningful (7).
      </p>
      <p>
        Username "toomuchdogfur" expressed wanting to volunteer at an animal shelter because she can't have a dog at home, so they would like to interact with dogs while volunteering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Username "Traveller107" had a very rewarding experience volunteering for the RSPCA but expressed issues dealing with people who cared less about the cause than they did. However they did also mention they met some of the most kindhearted people as well(9).
      </p>
      <p>
        Username "garffi" volunteered in the afternoons and said they mainly took dogs on walks and picked up poop. According to them, the morning shifts require more work, but did not give a reason why.(9)

        The volunteer positions are mixture of what is needed and what each individual volunteer is good at/would like to do (10).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the article "11 Things I Learned Volunteering at an Animal Shelter," by Shannon Kop, she talks about the experience as one of self-care and self-discovery, not just of care for the animals (11).
      </p>
      <p>
        Chrissy Spalone from One Green Planet offers volunteering at an animal shelter, sanctuary, or wildlife rescue as an answer to these situations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            School Credit
          </li>
          <li>
            Boosting Your Resume
          </li>
          <li>
            Finding friends
          </li>
          <li>
            If you'd like to spend time with animals
          </li>
          <li>
            If you'd like to learn more about animals
          </li>
        </ul> 
        She mentions towards the end of the article that one can find a position that works for both your passion and specialty, there is a volunteering role that will work for you(12).

      <p>
        Volunteer 1: wanted to make a difference, and because she loved cats and people, volunteering at the shelter seemed a fun way to help both. She reports it as a very rewarding experience, because you get to know the animals and then you get to see them go to their new homes. For her, it was the most rewarding and wonderful thing she's ever done.
        </br>
        Volunteer 2: Started volunteering because she needed something in her life that made her feel like she was giving back to her community. Not only does volunteering at the shelter give her that, she feels the animals give her so much in return. 
        </br>
        Volunteer 3: Started volunteering because he loves dogs, and highly recommends the experience for animal lovers. 
        </br>
        Volunteer 4: Finds it an exhausting but highly rewarding experience (13). 
      </p>
      <p>
      What do the users need from the website:
      I did an informal interview with a group of fourr people who informed me that they would like all of the information necessary for signing up to volunteer as early in the process as possible, so they would be prepared for the steps ahead instead of bindsided by more information after they'd completed the form on the website.

        Extrapolating from both the primary and secondary research (as seen above), the three unifying demographics of the users of the proposed website are as follows: 
        <ol>
          <li>
            The free time necessary to volunteer
          </li>
          <li>
            The passion for the mission of the charity they are volunteering for (or just a love of animals/pets)
          </li>
          <li>
            Located in Australia (as the proposed site is specifically for RSPCA AU)
